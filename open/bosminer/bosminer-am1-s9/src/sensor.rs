//! This module contains interface for reading from sensor (`Sensor`) and what
//! constitutes a sensor reading (`Temperature`, `Measurement`).
//!
//! HOW TO EXTEND THIS IN THE FUTURE
//!
//! * Struct `Temperature` is not very generic and varies from sensor to sensor, so move it into
//!   sensor drivers. Struct `Measurement` is OK for now, it represents more or less the outcomes
//!   of temperature readout.
//!
//! * Each miner has a topology of sensors. It also has to know how to interpret the readout of
//!   each sensor (ie. make a `IntoS9Temperature` trait and then implement
//!   `IntoS9Temperature<TMP451SensorReadout>` and the like).
//!
//! * Maybe provide a generic temperature readout structure that has just the `local` and `remote`
//!   portions (and make a conversion function when needed).
