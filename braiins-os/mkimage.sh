# this script is used to automate disk image creation
# usage:
#   mkimage.sh [source [[upgrade] dest]]
#   source is directory with files for u-boot
#   upgrade is optional path to lede upgrade tarball
#   dest is file or directory (default name will be used) for resulting image
#
# image contains a fat32 partition and ext4 partition of fixed size
#   fat partition is for uBoot stuff (os image, uEnv.txt and such)
#   ext partition holds upgrade files (TBD)
#
# image creation requires severa additional tools to be installed:
#   sfdisk (by default in debian)
#   mkfs.ext (ditto)
#   mkfs.vfat (from dosfstools)
#   mcopy (mtools)

# perform these steps to build and prepare artifacts to work with
# ./bb.py --platform $target prepare
# ./bb.py --platform $target clean
# ./bb.py --platform $target prepare --update-feeds
# ./bb.py --platform $target build --key keys/test
# ./bb.py --platform $target deploy local_sd
